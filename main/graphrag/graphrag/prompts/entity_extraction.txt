-Goal-
Given a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity, first identify all entities needed from the text in order to capture the information and ideas in the text.
Next, report all relationships among the identified entities.

-Steps-
1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:
- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized
- entity_type: Suggest several labels or categories for the entity. The categories should not be specific, but should be as general as possible.
- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities
Format each entity as ("entity"{tuple_delimiter}<entity_name>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_type>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_description>)

2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.
For each pair of related entities, extract the following information:
- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1
- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1
- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other
- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity
Format each relationship as ("relationship"{tuple_delimiter}<source_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<target_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_description>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_strength>)

3. Return output in Chinese as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **{record_delimiter}** as the list delimiter.

4. If you have to translate into Chinese, just translate the descriptions, nothing else!

5. When finished, output {completion_delimiter}.

Example 1:

text:
，木叉行者说∶“前来见你的师父和师兄们！”那妖怪整整衣服，拜见了师父，唐僧很高兴又收了个徒弟，给他剃了头，取名沙和尚。 
　　沙和尚取下脖子上挂的九个骷髅，用绳子一串，又把观音菩萨的红葫芦拴在当中，放到河里，立刻变成一只小船。唐僧在八戒和悟净的搀扶下上了船，向西岸驶去。悟空牵

Example 2:

text:
着白龙马，在船后紧紧跟随。 
　　到了岸上，木叉行者收起了红葫芦，那些骷髅立刻化成九股阴风一会儿就不见了。唐僧拜谢了木叉行者，又向南边谢了观音菩萨，然后才跨上白马，带着三个徒弟又向西赶路。
