{"result": "To address this issue, you should:\n\n1. Re-examine and refine your entity specification to ensure it is comprehensive enough to cover all potentially relevant entities in a text document.\n2. Enhance the claim description by providing more specific details about what constitutes an \"any claims or facts that could be relevant to information discovery.\" This might involve listing common patterns, types of claims (e.g., financial fraud, illegal activities), or attributes you're particularly interested in identifying.\n\nWhen revising your input, ensure each entity meets these criteria and is clearly defined. Here's a revised version:\n\n**Revised Entity Specification:**\n- ['organization', 'person', 'geo', 'event']\n  \n**Revised Claim Description:**\nAny claims that involve accusations or facts about organizations being involved in illegal activities (like fraud), individuals' misconduct, geographical locations associated with notable events, or specific historical events.\n\n**Revised Text:**\n(Note: This is just an example of how you might structure the text. The actual text should contain claims and entities relevant to your query.)\n\n---\n\n**Example Revised Output:**\n\n(COMPANY X<|>NONE<|>FINANCIAL FRAUD<|>FALSE<|>2019-01-01T00:00:00<|>2019-12-31T00:00:00<|>Company X was accused of financial fraud, but investigations concluded there were no grounds for charges.<|>Accusations made by anonymous sources in various social media posts.)\n\n## (INDIVIDUAL Y<|>NONE<|>CRIMINAL CONDUCT<|>SUSPECTED<|>2018-06-01T00:00:00<|>2018-12-31T00:00:00<|>Individual Y was suspected of criminal conduct involving misuse of company funds.<|>Claims made by former colleagues and internal audits.)\n\n## (LOCATION Z<|>NONE<|>HISTORICAL EVENT<|>TRUE<|>1945-08-06T00:00:00<|>1945-08-23T00:00:00<|>Location Z was the site of a significant World War II battle that resulted in heavy casualties on both sides.<|>Documentation from military archives and historical records.)\n\n## (EVENT W<|>NONE<|>CULTURAL IMPORTANCE<|>TRUE<|>2015-07-16T00:00:00<|>2015-07-30T00:00:00<|>Event W was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site for its cultural significance.<|>UNESCO announcement and relevant reports.)\n\n---\n\nThis revised approach should help you capture more entities that align with your specified criteria.

Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3.
