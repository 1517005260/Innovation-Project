{"result": "The provided text is in Chinese and appears to be a set of guidelines or procedures for handling student appeals within an educational institution. Given the nature of the document, it does not contain any specific named entities (such as 'organization', 'person', 'geo', or 'event') that are directly involved in claims. The text mainly outlines the process for students to appeal decisions made by their school.\n\nHowever, to meet the requirements of the task, I will follow the steps and format as closely as possible, even though the text does not provide specific examples of claims against entities. In this case, the \"claims\" would be the general conditions under which an appeal can be made, and the \"entities\" would be the general roles (like \"student\" and \"school\") rather than specific named entities.\n\nLet's break down the information:\n\n### Step 1: Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification.\n- **Entity Specification**: ['organization', 'person', 'geo', 'event']\n- **Entities Identified**:\n  - **Organization**: 学校 (School)\n  - **Person**: 学生 (Student) - Note: This is a role, not a specific person.\n  - **Geo**: 上海 (Shanghai) - Mentioned as the location where further appeals can be made.\n  - **Event**: 复查 (Re-examination / Appeal Review) - This is a procedural event.\n\n### Step 2: Extract all claims associated with the identified entities.\n- **Claim Description**: Any claims or facts that could be relevant to information discovery.\n\n### Claims Identified\n1. **Claim 1**\n   - **Subject**: SCHOOL<|>\n   - **Object**: STUDENT<|>\n   - **Claim Type**: APPEAL PROCEDURE<|>\n   - **Claim Status**: TRUE<|>\n   - **Claim Date**: NONE<|>NONE<|>\n   - **Claim Description**: The school has a defined procedure for students to appeal decisions.

Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4.
