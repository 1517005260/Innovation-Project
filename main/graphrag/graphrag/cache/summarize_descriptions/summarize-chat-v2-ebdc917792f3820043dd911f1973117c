{"result": "观世音菩萨与孙悟空之间存在着紧密而复杂的关系。当面对无法解决的难题时，孙悟空常常会求助于观音菩萨，这不仅体现了他们之间的联系，也反映了观音菩萨在孙悟空心中的重要地位。例如，在对抗黑风怪的过程中，孙悟空与观音菩萨合作，共同设计了一个巧妙的计划来取回被抢走的袈裟，展现了他们协同作战的能力。然而，这种关系并非始终和谐无间，孙悟空因紧箍咒带来的痛苦而对观音菩萨产生了不满情绪，甚至一度想要找她理论。尽管如此，观音菩萨依然是孙悟空在关键时刻寻求帮助的重要对象。", "input": "\nYou are an expert in 神话文学 (Mythological Literature).
