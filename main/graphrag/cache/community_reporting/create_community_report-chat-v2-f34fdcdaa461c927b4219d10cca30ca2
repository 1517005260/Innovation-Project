When possible, include representative named entities in the title.\n- SUMMARY: An executive summary of the community's overall structure, how its entities are related to each other, and significant points associated with its entities.\n- REPORT RATING: A float score between 0-10 that represents the relevance of the text to education policies, university administration, student conduct, financial aid, and social welfare programs, with 1 being trivial or irrelevant and 10 being highly significant, impactful, and essential for understanding the university's regulations, policies, and support systems for students.\n- RATING EXPLANATION: Give a single sentence explanation of the rating.\n- DETAILED FINDINGS: A list of 5-10 key insights about the community. Each insight should have a short summary followed by multiple paragraphs of explanatory text grounded according to the grounding rules below. Be comprehensive.\n\nReturn output as a well-formed JSON-formatted string with the following format. Don't use any unnecessary escape sequences. The output should be a single JSON object that can be parsed by json.loads.\n    {\n        \"title\": \"<report_title>\",\n        \"summary\": \"<executive_summary>\",\n        \"rating\": <threat_severity_rating>,\n        \"rating_explanation\": \"<rating_explanation>\"\n        \"findings\": \"[{\"summary\":\"<insight_1_summary>\", \"explanation\": \"<insight_1_explanation\"}, {\"summary\":\"<insight_2_summary>\", \"explanation\": \"<insight_2_explanation\"}]\"\n    }\n\n# Grounding Rules\nAfter each paragraph, add data record reference if the content of the paragraph was derived from one or more data records. Reference is in the format of [records: <record_source> (<record_id_list>, ...<record_source> (<record_id_list>)]. If there are more than 10 data records, show the top 10 most relevant records.\nEach paragraph should contain multiple sentences of explanation and concrete examples with specific named entities. All paragraphs must have these references at the start and end. Use \"NONE\" if there are no related roles or records. Everything should be in Chinese.\n\nExample paragraph with references added:\nThis is a paragraph of the output text [records: Entities (1, 2, 3), Claims (2, 5), Relationships (10, 12)]\n\n# Example Input\n-----------\nText:\n\nEntities\n\nid,entity,description\n5,ABILA CITY PARK,Abila City Park is the location of the POK rally\n\nRelationships\n\nid,source,target,description\n37,ABILA CITY PARK,POK RALLY,Abila City Park is the location of the POK rally\n38,ABILA CITY PARK,POK,POK is holding a rally in Abila City Park\n39,ABILA CITY PARK,POKRALLY,The POKRally is taking place at Abila City Park\n40,ABILA CITY PARK,CENTRAL BULLETIN,Central Bulletin is reporting on the POK rally taking place in Abila City Park\n\nOutput:\n{\n    \"title\": \"Abila City Park and POK Rally\",\n    \"summary\": \"The community revolves around the Abila City Park, which is the location of the POK rally.
