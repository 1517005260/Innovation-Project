This involves examining the structure of policies, their implementation, and their impact on various aspects of the university environment such as student welfare, academic standards, campus life, and ethical conduct. The analysis should uncover insights into how these policies affect students, faculty, and staff, and propose recommendations for improvement based on identified strengths and weaknesses.\n\nKey Parts:\n1. **Community Analysis**: Identification of key stakeholders, their roles, and relationships within the educational community.\n2. **Policy Evaluation**: Reviewing existing educational policies and standards, assessing their effectiveness, and identifying areas for improvement.\n3. **Impact Assessment**: Evaluating how policies affect different segments of the university community, including students, staff, and faculty.\n4. **Recommendations for Enhancement**: Based on the findings, developing actionable recommendations aimed at improving policy efficiency, enhancing student experience, and promoting ethical conduct.\n5. **Policy Effectiveness Monitoring**: Regular review and monitoring of implemented policies to assess their long-term impact and make necessary adjustments.\n\nOutput:\nProducing comprehensive reports that provide in-depth insights into community dynamics, policy effectiveness, and recommendations for enhancement. These reports aim to inform decision-makers and stakeholders about significant developments in the university system, their implications, and strategies to address challenges and capitalize on opportunities for growth and improvement.. The content of this report includes an overview of the community's key entities and relationships.\n\n# Report Structure\nThe report should include the following sections:\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific. When possible, include representative named entities in the title.\n- SUMMARY: An executive summary of the community's overall structure, how its entities are related to each other, and significant points associated with its entities.\n- REPORT RATING: A float score between 0-10 that represents the relevance of the text to education policies, university administration, student conduct, financial aid, and social welfare programs, with 1 being trivial or irrelevant and 10 being highly significant, impactful, and essential for understanding the university's regulations, policies, and support systems for students.\n- RATING EXPLANATION: Give a single sentence explanation of the rating.\n- DETAILED FINDINGS: A list of 5-10 key insights about the community. Each insight should have a short summary followed by multiple paragraphs of explanatory text grounded according to the grounding rules below. Be comprehensive.\n\nReturn output as a well-formed JSON-formatted string with the following format. Don't use any unnecessary escape sequences. The output should be a single JSON object that can be parsed by json.loads.\n    {\n        \"title\": \"<report_title>\",\n        \"summary\": \"<executive_summary>\",\n        \"rating\": <threat_severity_rating>,\n        \"rating_explanation\": \"<rating_explanation>\"\n        \"findings\": \"[{\"summary\":\"<insight_1_summary>\", \"explanation\": \"<insight_1_explanation\"}, {\"summary\":\"<insight_2_summary>\", \"explanation\": \"<insight_2_explanation\"}]\"\n    }\n\n# Grounding Rules\nAfter each paragraph, add data record reference if the content of the paragraph was derived from one or more data records. Reference is in the format of [records: <record_source> (<record_id_list>, ...<record_source> (<record_id_list>)]. If there are more than 10 data records, show the top 10 most relevant records.\nEach paragraph should contain multiple sentences of explanation and concrete examples with specific named entities. All paragraphs must have these references at the start and end. Use \"NONE\" if there are no related roles or records.
