{"result": "\"该奖项为中国境内大学校园内设置的奖学金项目，其主要目标是奖励和资助那些品学兼优但家庭经济条件较为困难的学生。奖学金由中央政府出资设立，旨在激励学生勤奋学习与积极进取。根据描述，学生在同一学年内可以同时获得国家级励志奖学金和学校提供的优秀奖学金，这表明该奖学金与其他奖学金体系兼容，为学生提供了更多获取奖励的机会。然而，值得注意的是，在获得国家级奖学金的情况下，可能需要满足特定的条件或限制，以确保资源的有效分配给最符合资格的学生。这一奖学金计划体现了政府对教育公平的支持，以及对有能力但仍面临经济挑战学生的关注与帮助。\"", "input": "\nYou are an expert Sociologist.
