{"result": "观世音菩萨与孙悟空是《西游记》中紧密合作的角色。在故事中，两人曾共同合作对付黑风怪，其中悟空负责设计计划，而观音则执行了关键步骤。此外，在袈裟失窃的问题上，观音菩萨也响应了悟空的请求，帮助解决了这一难题。当遇到棘手问题时，孙悟空往往会选择向观音菩萨求助以获得支持和解决方案。值得注意的是，悟空还认为唐僧所使用的紧箍咒是由观音菩萨传授的，并因此打算找她理论，这一点也显示了他对紧箍咒来源的认识。通过这些互动可以看出，观世音菩萨不仅是取经团队的重要支援力量，也是孙悟空在困难时刻可以依靠的对象。", "input": "\nYou are an expert in Comparative Mythology and Literary Analysis.
